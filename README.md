## Three Observations

#1.	Of the four regimens that were focused on (Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), the data show that Capomulin and Ramicane are the most effective treatments with Ramicane showing slightly more promising results.
#2.	From the line plot for mouse s185 for Capomulin, tumor volume reduced dramatically.  Conversely, plugging in other mice on other treatments, outside of Ramicine, showed increased tumor growth (including the placebo).
#3.	The data also show that the average tumor volume is strongly correlated with higher mouse weight as heavier mice showed greater average tumor volume.  This is also supported by a correlation value of .84 as well as an r-squared value of .7088
